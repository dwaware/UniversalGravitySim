# UniversalGravitySim
Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation

Force-based solar system sim useful for testing interaction between asteroids (or comets, etc.) and other planets/stars.

Clicking the screen destroys the current asteroid and creates a new one where the user clicked.  The speed of the new asteroid increases as the user continues to hold the mouse button down, up to a preset maximum, and when the user releases the mouse button the asteroid begins its journey.
